Welcome to our **fake e-commerce website**, KittyShop. This project was made by the **Vocal_15** during the ninth week of *The Hacking Project* bootcamp.



This project was a warm up of our final project.
Here the story telling : 

> Two entrepreneurs have contacted your group to realize your first freelance mission. Your goal is to create a website that will sell pictures of kittens.
> The store will be simple: a user comes on the site and is welcomed by an index of the items for sale. He can see a detailed view of these products, and add them to his cart after registration. From this cart, he can order the wanted picture(s) and pay via Stripe. He will receive the products by email, and the administrator will receive an email informing him that a sale was made.
